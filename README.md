# Loan-approval-ML

This project uses machine learning models to predict whether a customer would get rejected or approved to receive a loan (loan_status) based on multiple features. It uses algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors, with hyperparameter tuning (Bayesian Optimization). The data is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset) and was split into training and testing sets.
